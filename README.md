DataFirst Screensaver
=====================

DataFirst Research Unit is a research unit attached to the University of Cape Town. Commerce I.T. provides technical support for the Computer Resource Centre. Due to problems with the existing Microsoft Scrolling Marquee Screensaver currently being used, a request was made for it to be replaced with this version of the Screensaver.

The actual screensaver is a flash animation whilst the screensaver program uses Simple Screensaver 1.0 to display the flash animation.
